# üîç GOOGLE OAUTH ISSUE DIAGNOSED!

## ‚úÖ **DNS Working**
Your domain **matalino.online** is now properly configured and loading! ‚úÖ

## ‚ùå **OAuth Issue Found**

I've identified exactly why Google OAuth isn't working:

### **Problem 1: Wrong Environment Variable**

**Current Value in Vercel:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = "https://src-jay-cadmus-projects-02376606.vercel.app"
```

**Should Be:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL = "https://matalino.online"
```

This means when you click "Continue with Google", the app is trying to redirect to the OLD Vercel URL instead of your custom domain.

### **Problem 2: Missing Redirect URLs in Supabase**

Supabase likely doesn't have these redirect URLs configured:
- `https://matalino.online/auth/callback`
- `https://www.matalino.online/auth/callback`

---

## üîß **THE FIX (2 Steps)**

### **STEP 1: Update Vercel Environment Variable**

**Option A: Via Dashboard (Recommended - Takes 2 minutes)**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/jay-cadmus-projects-02376606/src/settings/environment-variables

2. Find `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

3. Click the "..." menu on the right ‚Üí "Edit"

4. Change the value from:
   ```
   https://src-jay-cadmus-projects-02376606.vercel.app
   ```
   
   To:
   ```
   https://matalino.online
   ```

5. Click "Save"

**Option B: Via CLI**

I can help you do this via command line - just let me know and I'll run the commands for you.

### **STEP 2: Add Redirect URLs in Supabase**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hpnmahfdjapnlnhhiqpf/auth/url-configuration

2. In the "Redirect URLs" section, click "Add URL" and add:
   ```
   https://matalino.online/auth/callback
   ```

3. Click "Add URL" again and add:
   ```
   https://www.matalino.online/auth/callback
   ```

4. Update the "Site URL" field to:
   ```
   https://matalino.online
   ```

5. **IMPORTANT:** Scroll down and click "Save"

---

## üöÄ **STEP 3: Redeploy**

After updating both:

```bash
vercel --prod --force
```

This will redeploy with the new environment variable.

---

## ‚úÖ **Expected Result**

After these fixes:

1. Visit: https://matalino.online/auth/login
2. Click: "Continue with Google"
3. OAuth flow:
   - ‚úÖ Redirects to Google
   - ‚úÖ You authorize
   - ‚úÖ Redirects to: `https://matalino.online/auth/callback`
   - ‚úÖ Redirects to: `https://matalino.online/dashboard`
   - ‚úÖ You're logged in!

---

## üß™ **Alternative Test (Email/Password)**

While we fix OAuth, you can test with email/password:

1. Visit: https://matalino.online/test-auth
2. Email: `jay.cadmus@innovixdynamix.com`
3. Password: `Jaychanti78!`
4. This should work immediately (doesn't need redirect URLs)

---

## üéØ **What I Can Do For You**

I can:
1. ‚úÖ Update the Vercel environment variable via CLI (if you prefer)
2. ‚úÖ Redeploy the application
3. ‚úÖ Test the OAuth flow after changes
4. ‚ùå Cannot update Supabase redirect URLs (needs dashboard access)

**Let me know:**
- **Option A:** "Update env var via CLI" - I'll do it for you
- **Option B:** "I'll do it via dashboard" - You update in Vercel dashboard, then I'll redeploy

---

## üìä **Why This Happened**

When we first deployed, we used the Vercel URL. Now that you have a custom domain, we need to update:
1. The environment variable (so app knows its URL)
2. Supabase redirect URLs (so OAuth knows where to go back)

**üéØ Quick Summary: Update NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL to matalino.online + Add redirect URLs in Supabase + Redeploy = Working OAuth!**
